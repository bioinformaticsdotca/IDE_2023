# Answer Key for Assignment

## tMRCA Estimation
1. When was the last common ancestor of the ON Deer clade?
2021-08-10

2. What about the last common ancestor of this clade and the nearest other sequences?
2020-08-26

3. Does the trend line for the molecular clock (tip-to-root regression) look a good fit? Do you think there may be more than 1 mutation rate in these samples? 
It looks like deer have a different mutation rate to the rest of the samples - suggesting more than 1 mutation rate is needed to model these samples e.g., a relaxed clock model

4. Given the amount of data and your answer to 1, how accurate do you think the inferred node date is?
Not very

5. How might you represent the degree of certainty or uncertainty in these estimates?
Confidence intervals in a likelihood framework, credibility intervals/posterior distribution in Bayesian

## Ancestral Trait Inference
1. Based on this analysis was the common ancestor of the ON Deer+Human clade inferred to have been in a human or in a deer?
Deer

2. What about the common ancestor of the wider ON Deer+Human, MI Mink+Human clades?
Human

3. Why might this analysis be misleading?
Big gaps without sampling, not a lot of sampling of animals

4. Where is the ON Deer+Human clade inferred to have originated: Ontario or Michigan?
Michigan

## Selection Analysis
1. At the top of the page there is a summary of the result, is there any sign of increased episodic selection in this clade?
No

2. Look at the fitted tree output below, based on the colorbar in the legend for values of ω (dN/dS), is the inferred ω > 1 or < 1 in the branches leading up to the ON Deer+Human clade?
<1 

3. What might this represent in terms of the differences between deer and human immune responses?
Minimal selective pressure from deer immune system therefore lots of drift

4. Can you think of any limitations of this analysis?
Same issue as above, not a lot of samples over a long time period and very little sampling of other animals.
