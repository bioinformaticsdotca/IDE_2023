# Background

The primary objective of the Module 5 lab will be to provide a practical overview of cgMLST, a genome-based typing method widely adopted in bacterial genomic surveillance networks across the globe. The widespread adoption of cgMLST is due in large part to recent advances in high-throughput sequencing, which have enabled the routine adoption of whole genome sequencing in microbial surveillance, coupled with the development of efficient computational algorithms to perform Multi Locus Sequence Typing at genome scales.Â 

The implementation of cgMLST by the PulseNet International network for foodborne outbreak surveillance has made it possible for WGS data to be used as evidence in public health investigations. Here, you will work with cgMLST data to conduct a retrospective analysis on a dataset that includes a number of possible Salmonella enterica outbreaks. Salmonella, which is primarily transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated foods, is one of the leading enteric pathogens in Canada and across the globe and was the first pathogen for which comprehensive genomic surveillance was implemented in Canada.

The outbreak dataset consists of WGS data from isolates recovered from samples collected from a diverse range of geographical regions, environments, and timelines that can be dated back to the early 2000s. Curating this outbreak dataset involved querying a global bacterial genomic surveillance database (GenomeTrakr) and PubMed queries to identify peer-reviewed publications that reported retrospective genomic analysis of Salmonella outbreaks. In this exercise, you will use a custom workflow written in the R language for statistical computing that includes modules that perform various steps in genomic epidemiologic analysis using cgMLST data. Your challenge will be to leverage the tools and data at your disposal to establish high quality cgMLST profiles that can be used to infer ancestral relationships between the various Salmonella isolates, and to explore patterns in the data in order to synthesise possible interpretations based on all available genomic and epidemiological data.

To start, you will be provided with pre-computed cgMLST allele calls generated by chewBBACA (Silva et al. 2018, PMID: 29543149), using a Salmonella core genome scheme based on 3,000 loci. Minor filtering has been performed to remove loci with zero informative alleles across the entire dataset. The following code template was used to call chewBBACA on a set of Salmonella genomes consolidated in a single directory called `/path/to/my_genomes`:

``` bash
chewBBACA.py AlleleCall -i /path/to/my_genomes/ -g /path/to/cgMLST_scheme/ -o /path/to/results
```

## Learning Objectives

-   Understanding the significance of metrics used for MLST-based quality control
-   Explaining the difference between core, accessory and pan-genome loci and their use in MLST analysis
-   Building dendrograms from MLST data
-   Familiarisation with the ggtree R library for tree visualization
-   Exploring the clonality of bacterial populations in the context of bactertial foodborne outbreaks
-   Leveraging epidemiological data by linking it to MLST-based dendrograms to explain molecular differences and infer possible outbreak scenarios

## Analysis Dataset

The dataset for Module 5 lab has been uploaded to Google Sheets:

1.  [Metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12gvH6U5pwj8QK-Ui3lOIYOm_X-69A2IE0cbctaEzY5E/edit?usp=sharing#gid=1448009352)
2.  [cgMLST data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12gvH6U5pwj8QK-Ui3lOIYOm_X-69A2IE0cbctaEzY5E/edit?usp=sharing#gid=8240612)

# Getting Started

Let's begin by loading all R packages and helper scripts required to run all the code in this lab.

> [Every time you begin a new R session, you must reload all the packages and scripts!]{.underline}

```{r load pkgs and helper scripts}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(data.table))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(treedataverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggnewscale))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ComplexHeatmap))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(circlize))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(randomcoloR))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(RColorBrewer))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(phangorn))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
source("src/mlst_helper.R")
source("src/ggtree_helper.R")
source("src/cluster_helper.R")
```

Next, read the cgMLST data and metadata into memory using `fread()` from the `data.table` package.

```{r load data}
# data paths
metadata_path <- "data/senterica_metadata_full.tsv"
cgmlst_path <- "data/senterica_cgMLST_full.tsv"
# read file
meta <- fread(metadata_path, sep = "\t")
cgmlst <- fread(cgmlst_path, sep = "\t")
```

# cgMLST QC

Before proceeding any further, you will first need to evaluate cgMLST data quality. A number of quality criteria will be defined to determine whether the properties of the allele profiles meet quality standards. Incomplete genome assembly and reference bias during MLST scheme construction can introduce significant levels of missing information in MLST data in the form of unassigned alleles at various loci. Hence, care must be taken to avoid comparisons that include loci and genomes with excessive numbers of unassigned alleles that could reduce the precision of genetic similarity calculations to be used for generating dendrograms for inferring relationships between the various genomes in the dataset. Below, you will conduct a series of steps to compute the frequency of unassigned alleles across each locus (i.e. columns) and genome (i.e. rows), which will inform the identification of poor quality loci/genomes that may need to be flagged for removal from downstream analyses.

> [Editable parts of the code have been highlighted in the code chunks.]{.underline} You are highly encouraged to adjust them to observe how different parameters affect the outcome.

# Hamming Distance

Distance-based and character-based methods can both be used to construct dendrograms from cgMLST data. However, in the scope of this lab we will only cover distance-based dendrograms, as character-based methods will be covered extensively in other modules. In phylogenetic analysis, distance-based approaches are rather flexible in the sense that they can be constructed from any measure that quantifies genetic similarity, including distances computed by alignment-free (e.g. Mash) or alignment-based (e.g. BLAST) similarity search algorithms. Below, you are introduced to a metric called the "Hamming distance" that is based on computing a distance based on the number of differences between a pair of character vectors.

Given two character vectors of equal lengths, hamming distance is the total number of positions in which the two vectors are [different:]{.underline}

Profile A: `[ 0 , 2 , 0 , 5 , 5 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]`

Profile B: `[ 0 , 1 , 0 , 4 , 3 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]`

Â Â A != B: `[ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 ]`

Hamming distance = sum( A != B ) = 3

```{r calculate hamming distance}
dist_mat <- cgmlst_final %>% 
  column_to_rownames("#Name") %>% 
  t() %>% 
  hamming()
# print matrix dimension
# the dimension should be symmetric!
dim(dist_mat)
```

In the context of two cgMLST profiles, a Hamming distance can be calculated based on the number of differences in alleles at.all loci. Hamming distances will be computed in an all vs all fashion to generate a pairwise distance matrix that will serve as the input for distance-based tree-building algorithms such as UPGMA and Neighbour-joining. We will visualise the clustering patterns in the distance matrix using the ComplexHeatmap package. We will also overlay serovar information to examine inter- and intra-serovar distances.

```{r distance matrix viz}
# create column annotations for heatmap
# to display serovar information
heatmap_annot <- metadata$serovar
names(heatmap_annot) <- metadata$ID
heatmap_annot <- heatmap_annot[order(factor(names(heatmap_annot),
                                            levels = rownames(dist_mat)))]
# create heatmap
dist_mat %>% 
  Heatmap(
    name = "cgMLST\nDistance",
    show_row_names = F, # do not display row labels
    show_column_names = F, # do not display column labels
    # use custom color gradient
    col = colorRamp2(
      c(min(dist_mat), mean(dist_mat), max(dist_mat)),
      c("#7ece97", "#eebd32", "#f76c6a")
    ),
    # add column annotation to show serovar info
    top_annotation = HeatmapAnnotation(
      Serovar = heatmap_annot,
      col = list(
					"Serovar" = structure(brewer.pal(length(unique(heatmap_annot)), "Set1"),
																names = unique(heatmap_annot))
      )
    )
  )
```

# Dendrogram Construction

Here you will construct a neighbour-joining tree using the `nj()` function from the ape package. Alternatively, a UPGMA tree can be constructed by simply replacing `method = 'nj'` with `method = 'upgma'` in the code chunk below.

To visualise the resulting dendrogram, you will interact with the R package ggtree, which offers an extensive suite of functions to manipulate, visualize, and annotate tree-like data structures. In this section, you will be introduced to the different visual capabilities of the ggtree package, and progressively update the same tree with several layers of visual annotations based on available metadata.

## A Simple Tree Vis

To start, run the following code chunk to plot a circular tree of the entire dataset with the tree tips colored by serovar information.

> You can assign a different metadata field to the `color_var` variable to update the mapping of the color aesthetics in the tree. For example setting `color_var = "Country"` will color the tree tips by the country of origin

```{r core genome tree}
##### EDITABLE VARIABLE #####
color_var <- "serovar"
#############################

# set random seed
set.seed(123)
# determine category count
# in the color aes variable
n_colors <- length(unique(pull(metadata, !!sym(color_var))))
# construct a core genome tree 
# using nj algorithm
cg_tree <- distance_tree(
  matrix = dist_mat,
  method = "nj"
)
# plot core genome tree and
# colouring the tree tips 
# by color_var
cg_tree_p <- cg_tree %>% 
  ggtree(layout = "circular",
         size = 0.75) %<+% metadata +
  geom_tippoint(aes(color = !!sym(color_var)),
                size = 2) +
  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3) ) ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = distinctColorPalette(n_colors))
# print tree plot object
cg_tree_p
```

## Clustering by Distance

Identifying clusters in genomic data through the application of a distance threshold so that groups of genomes sharing a below-threshold distance level (i.e. highly similar profiles) is a common practice in genomic surveillance and epidemiological investigations. Detecting novel clusters comprising pathogen isolates from human clinical cases can signal the emergence of an outbreak requiring a public health response and can provide important epidemiological insights on outbreak progression.

Similarly, the co-clustering of outbreak isolates with isolates from food/environmental sources can help link the outbreak to possible sources/reservoirs of the pathogen in order to inform prevention and control measures. In this section, you will generate genomic clusters from the dataset by applying several distance cutoffs. You will then place clusters within the dendrogram and analyse cluster memberships to spot possible outbreaks in the dataset.

```{r cluster by distance}
# define clustering distance cutoffs
dist_cutoff <- c(0, seq(5, 100, 5), seq(200, 1000, 100))
# perform complete linkage clustering
hclust_res <- map(dist_cutoff, function(x) {
  dist_mat %>% 
    as.dist() %>% 
    hclust(method = "complete") %>% 
    cutree(h = x) %>% 
    as.factor()
})
names(hclust_res) <- paste0("clust_", dist_cutoff)
# print clustering results table
(
  clusters <- data.frame(hclust_res) %>% 
    rownames_to_column("ID")
  )
```

Let's now superimpose the clustering information on the previous tree to examine whether the above code chunk has generated sensible cluster assignments. Run the code chunk below to insert text labels that span tree tips assigned to the same clusters at [a specified threshold]{.underline}.

> You can update the `target_threshold` variable to examine how cluster membership changes in response to clustering distance cutoffs.

```{r cg tree cluster viz}

# Group Exercise

1.  Review the cgMLST profiles before and after the removal of low quality genomes, and identify two samples that exceed \>1% unassigned alleles (i.e. with more than 27 unassigned alleles).

2.  Review the circular tree and identify which serovar(s) is/are not monophyletic (i.e. serovars that are distributed in multiple areas of the tree).

3.  Use the functions: `serovar_subtree()`, `cluster_subtree()`, `cluster_summary()` to analyse one particular serovar and identify three clusters that likely correspond to different outbreaks.

4.  Identify genomic clusters that fit the following criteria and consider possible scenarios for interpretation of genomic data and epidemiological metadata:

    a.  A genomic cluster comprising human clinical cases with similar geographical and temporal information

    b.  A genomic cluster in which the human clinical cases are dispersed in geography and/or time

    c.  A genomic cluster in which human clinical isolates cluster with non-human isolates from a particular source type

    d.  A genomic cluster in which human clinical isolates cluster with non-human isolates from multiple source types.

    e.  Genomes from different genomic clusters identified within a single putative outbreak that can be linked to a common source

5.  Is it important to analyze clusters at different distance cutoffs? Why?

6.  What functional products could be encoded by the accessory loci in the data?
